# Auto-Prompt Algorithm for GPT

## Overview

This repository contains the initial code structure for an Auto-Prompt Algorithm designed to enhance interactions with Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. It enables the GPT to analyze complex user prompts, break them down into manageable tasks, auto-prompt itself in a chain of thought to complete these tasks, and perform web searches or code generation as needed.

## Components

- `main.py`: The entry point for the algorithm, orchestrating the task decomposition, execution, and feedback loop.
- `nlp_module.py`: Handles Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks including prompt analysis and task decomposition.
- `task_scheduler.py`: Manages task prioritization and execution order based on dependencies.
- `auto_prompter.py`: Generates dynamic prompts for the GPT model based on the current task.
- `web_searcher.py`: Performs web searches and processes the results for tasks requiring external information.
- `code_generator.py`: Generates and validates code based on the task requirements.
- `feedback_loop.py`: Implements a feedback mechanism for iterative refinement based on user feedback.

## Usage

To use this algorithm with your GPT model, you'll need to implement the logic within each component based on your specific requirements and integrate it with your GPT's operational environment. This may involve configuring API keys for web searches, setting up a code execution environment, and tailoring the NLP techniques to your model's capabilities.
